# Phase-Music
PD demonstration of Steve Reich's Phase Music
A chord arpeggio is played through two voices slightly different in speed (0.97 vs 0.92) that after a while (100 s) they each complete multiple integers of cycles (97 and 92 respectively) while their phase lag ascends from the initial value zero to the maxim (asymptote = 1). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56094118/224399589-e80664eb-95ad-432e-a053-e8ffa040346c.png)
